# YahtzeeGame

This is my first group-based computer science project from my junior year of high school. YahtzeeGame is a remake of the popular
dice game of Yahtzee. The game can be played alone in a group and consists of 13 turns per person.

## Getting Started

This is a Java game that can easily be run after downloading the bin folder and running the command

```
java YahtzeeGame
```

## Instructions

#### YahtzeeGame Objectives

The player has 5 dice and the objective of the game is to optimize what combinations those dice exhibit by
rerolling (up to 3 total rolls and holding any/none die after the initial roll):

* Ones (Add 1 point for every 1)
* Pair (Add 2 points for every 2)
* Threes (Add 3 points for every 3)
* Fours (Add 4 points for every 4)
* Fives (Add 5 points for every 5)
* Sixes (Add 6 points for every 6)
* Three of a kind (Sum all die)
* Four of a kind (Sum all die)
* Full House (25 points for 3 of a kind and a pair)
